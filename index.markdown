## Privacy for the rest of us

We often hear that we need to be concerned with privacy and security online. However, it's a very overwhelming topic to learn about! That's why students in Madrid, P2PU, and The Kansas City Public Library teamed up to develop these resources for folks who aren't computer scientists, but still want to be safe online!

This course has four modules, each of which take about 90 minutes to work through and are best completed as a group. The modules are: social media, privacy and security, information stored online, and cookies. 

There is no need to register or pay. All of these resources are openly licensed and here to be used. 
		
## Learning circles

As we mentioned, these materials are freely available for you to peruse through on your own. However, we designed the course to be taken in a group, and P2PU has put together some resources and tools that will help you bring a group together. If you're interested in working through this course locally, head to learningcircles.p2pu.org, create and account, and select this course for your learning circle. The facilitator handbook and community will help you along your way.
