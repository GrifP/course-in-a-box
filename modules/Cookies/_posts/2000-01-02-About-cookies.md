## 2. About cookies

#### A. Origins and types
We have seen more or less what cookies are, but where do they come from?

Its origins can be traced back to 1994, when Netscape Communications employee Leo Montulli used them in order to implement a virtual shopping cart for an e-commerce site. This way, the servers did not have to store any information about this, since it was done in the shopper’s browser.

This leads us to the first kind of cookies we will be considering: session cookies. These cookies, which are usually used to store credentials and such information, and expire very quickly, since they are normally deleted when you close your browser session.

In contraposition to session cookies we can find persistent cookies, which are those that expire at a certain date or after a fixed amount of time. They can be used to keep a user logged in when they don’t want to re-enter the password every time, but it is very common to use them for advertising purposes, since they can store your activity to be able to show you “personalized advertisements”. They can also be used for data collection and to personalize your settings in certain sites.

Another important type of cookie (independent of the previous separation) is third-party cookies. These are cookies which are not sent to us by the website we are visiting but by a third party who has some component inside this website, like an advertisement banner. These cookies can then be read by third parties as you navigate through the websites, potentially tracking all this activity. They can be used, for example for personalized advertising.

Lately there has been some talk about something called “supercookies”. These, however, work quite differently from regular cookies, and they are much more difficult to control. If you still want to know more about them we encourage you to find out.

#### B. Downsides and dangers
We have seen that cookies can be used to make our online experience more comfortable. However, they can also have downsides.

One of the most common criticisms towards cookies is that they invade our privacy. Many cookies are designed to get the maximum amount of information. For example, as we saw before, third-party cookies track your behavior across multiple domains, and some of these cookies can be in our browsers for long periods of time, so we have to ask ourselves how much privacy we want.

Cookies can also be dangerous when handled carelessly. For example, when we use a computer that is also used by somebody else, we must be careful not to leave behind any cookie with sensitive information, like authentication details of some account. If the person who uses that computer after us is nice, they might only use these cookies to prank us from our own account, be they also have the power to impersonate you or scam you.

Lastly, cookies can have security vulnerabilities. For example, normal HTTP cookies can be intercepted by anyone if we don’t use a secure connection. This does not happen, however, with secure cookies, only transferable through HTTPS, although can also compromise your data if otherwise stolen. Other problems can arise with not properly implemented cookies and out-of-date browsers.
