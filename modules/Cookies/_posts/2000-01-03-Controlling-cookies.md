## 3. Controlling cookies

Nowadays, almost every website uses cookies for a variety of reasons, but if you want to have more control over them you can follow some of the following advice:
* Modify your browser settings or use add-ons to control which cookies are stored by your browser. You can also eliminate the cookies already stored.
* Use private browsing options like the “Incognito” mode in Chrome or “Private Browsing” in Firefox. That way, all the cookies will be deleted at the end of every session (when you close all the windows).
* Be careful to never leave cookies with sensitive information on computers used by other people. For example, if you log into some service, do so using a private browsing mode or delete the cookies afterwards.
* Keep your browser up to date and only give personal information to trusted sites.
