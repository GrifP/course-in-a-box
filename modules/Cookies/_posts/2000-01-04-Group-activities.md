## 4. Group activities

#### A. Game
The following game can be played throughout the course, during a part of it or during the other group activity.

The participants will “act as cookies”. First, we randomly and secretly distribute the names of the participants among themselves, so that everyone has someone else, but that person doesn’t know. Then, throughout the elected duration of the game, each will record the activity of the person they have been assigned, writing down things like when they raise their hands, what they talk about, if they look at their phones, and so on.

At the end, everyone will talk about what they have written down, and the person it refers to will say how this “surveillance” has made them feel, whether it has affected their behavior, etc.

#### B. Debate
During this activity, we invite the participant to debate about a number of topics. Here are some suggestions, but the participants are also invited to make suggestions of their own:
* What do we consider desirable and undesirable uses of cookies? What do you think companies use them for?
* If we are monitored through cookies and thus our advertising and even search results are affected by our previous activities, do we feel uncomfortable? Do we feel manipulated? Or does it just make our navigation easier and focused on our interests?
