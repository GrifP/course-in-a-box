## 1. Introduction

Welcome to this new course on Internet privacy! This time we will try to give you an overview about how much and what kind of information is stored about you on the network. This information is known as digital footprint.

A digital footprint is made of the whole trail of data we leave behind while using the Internet. There are two types. The active digital footprint is made of all the data we put on the Internet on purpose in websites or social media, usually with the intent of sharing it. The passive digital footprint is made of data collected without the owner knowing. All this data can provide a lot of information about the person to which this data belongs, and information is power. 

Many companies rely on this data to create profiles of users; profiles that can be sold for a reasonable amount of money. Some companies like Facebook uses this data to provide personalized advertisements to users, showing them what they might be interested in, so Facebook can pay its bills with the money they receive from advertising agencies. Other companies may use this data to filter and discard their applicants before making a job interview. More extreme tracking can be made by malware in order to collect passwords or other personal data.

But hey, let’s not freak out! Something being powerful doesn’t mean it's going to be used for evil, but surely digital footprints have some issues with privacy. There are some regulations about it, and there’s definitely a bunch of things you can do to improve your privacy on the Internet. We’re not trying to scare you, we just want you to be aware of it and help you be safe. There are many reasons to care about your digital footprint, as you can see in this video:
