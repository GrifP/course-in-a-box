## 3. Improving your privacy

#### A. Basic tips for improving your privacy
Maybe at this point of the course you’ll be concerned about your privacy and all the personal data that may be on the Internet. Now it’s time to get on with improving your privacy and helping you be safe on the Internet. Using the Internet and leaving no digital footprint is impossible, but we can reduce it. There are some tips that can help you achieve it.

First things first, you have to care about your passwords. Here are little pieces of advice in order to improve your passwords security:
* Change your passwords regularly.
* Don’t use the same password in different accounts or websites.
* Have passwords at least 8 characters long (the longer the better) that mixes upper and lower case letters with numbers.
* Don’t let others use your personal devices.
* Lock your device in case of loss or theft
* Don’t send sensitive data via WiFi, especially via public WiFi.

Other option for improving your privacy is using alternative email accounts, in other words, email accounts that we use only to register in apps and are not our usual account that we use to communicate on a daily bases. Also there are temporary email accounts, that is, email accounts that have a limited lifespan, for example, 60 minutes. These services are created so users can log into websites or apps that they are going to use just once. This way, the users can protect their privacy by not providing an email account with any kind of personal data. This way we scatter the information we put on the Internet, so it’s more difficult to put it up together in order to build a profile about you. 

Last but not least, install an antivirus. This will keep you protected from malware that tries to steal your data. And one final note: encryption is important. If your data is encrypted, it will be hard to read if stolen. This is a more complicated topic we are not going to cover now, but just one tip: when your are browsing on the Internet use HTTPS instead of HTTP when possible. You will see it in your browser:

#### B. Regulation: right to be forgotten

As many aspects of privacy, digital footprints and the use of personal data are regulated by the laws of the country in which the website is registred.

For example, in the U.S.A., invasion of privacy can be used as cause of action (legal claim for which to seek compensation) in legal disputes. There are four categories:

* Intrusion of solitude: it arises where one person intrudes upon the private affairs of another, physically or electronically. For example, hacking into someone else's computer can be a type of intrusion.
* Public disclosure of private facts: it happens when someone reveals another person’s private information, when this information is not of public interest and its publication or dissemination can be considered offensive.
* False light: it’s the publication of facts that are highly offensive or embarrassing to reasonable people, with the act being carried out with malice. This term is similar to defamation, although it’s not the same, since the information needs not be false, but only misleading.
* Appropriation: it’s the unauthorized use of another person's name or likeness to obtain some benefits, and can violate either an individual’s right of privacy or right of publicity.

If we want to delete our digital footprint, there are many ways to reduce it, but it’s impossible to completely delete it. Some places in the world have laws that implement “the right to be forgotten”. The right to be forgotten reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them. This is a relatively new idea in the US, and it’s not yet implemented. In the European Union, Google put at users’ disposal a form in which users can ask Google to delete any information they have about them, in order to keep the right to be forgotten. You can see the form in the next link:
