## 5. Summary

In order to do this activity, you just need a device with a browser. It’s preferable that you aren’t logged into any account or social media in the browser. Take some time (5 minutes will be probably enough) to google yourself and browse through the results. After everyone is finished, answer in turns the following questions:

1. How many links have you found that were about you?
2. How many of them were social media? How many were blogs, posts or articles? In case there were other kind of content, what kind was it?
3. Did you expect there to be less? Did you expect there to be more? 
4. How much personal information did you find? Was it sensitive information?
5. Are you now more concerned about your privacy than before?

It is probable that you didn’t find many results. If you are not a public person nor use the Internet intensively, there might not be much relevant information about you. Also, many times we use nicknames in social media, so the link between those accounts and you isn’t so obvious.
