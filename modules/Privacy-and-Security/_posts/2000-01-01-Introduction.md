## 1. Introduction

In recent years, a lot of news have come out about the efforts of government agencies to collect information about peopleâ€™s telephone conversations, e-mails and other online information. While governments claim that it is a way of keeping their citizens safe, many users are worried about being spied upon.

Internet has many good things, but it also facilitates some crimes. The communication opportunities make it easier to get some dangerous objects, like weapons, and it makes it easier for criminals to gather and stay connected. These are some of the reasons that government agencies use when surveillance programs are uncovered.

On the other hand, this control over the internet, intended to find criminals, usually entails a large amount of data being collected from people who have done nothing wrong and would like to have an anonymous connection.

Along this course, we seek to explain some concepts that have led to traffic surveillance like the deep web, we will take a look at the current state of affairs explaining concepts like backdoors, and we will ponder some questions about the future.

We will also go over some advice in order to protect our privacy (from anyone, including malicious spies) and some concepts like encryption and Wi-Fi sniffers.

We also suggest some group activities in order to assimilate these concepts better, and we end we a brief conclusion on the topic.

To begin, let us ask ourselves, how much of our personal information are we willing to give up in order to be safer? We will come back to this during the activities.
