## 2. About privacy

#### A. Deep web
After some of events of the last few years, especially those involving terrorist attacks, many governments have expressed their wish to increase the amount of information they have on internet users in order to better prevent this kind of attacks from happening again.

Although the scandals involving governments which have triggered the privacy and security debate come from monitoring “usual” internet activity, other kinds of connections are also monitored. We are talking about the deep web or invisible web.

The deep web are the contents of the internet which are not indexed by usual search engines, that is, they will not be linked from the search results of a standard search engine. This can happen for a variety of reasons, like if the paged is not linked to from any other page, in which case the search engine will not be able to find it or if it can only be accessed with certain credentials (like a password) or software (like Tor). Although it is hard to determine for certain, it is estimated that the deep web is several hundred times larger than the surface web (the parts that are indexed).

The deep web has a lot of useful content, like private pages of banks and things like that, but some parts of the deep web are intentionally hidden from normal connections and can only be accessed using special networks like Tor or I2P. Here, a lot of illegal activities go on, being drug markets one of the most common, but also others like gun markets, illegal pornography or trade of stolen items. It is also used by some (like Wikileaks) for anonymous whistleblowing.

Surfing the dark web is not impossible, and there are multiple pages that show us how, but it can be dangerous, since we can be exposed to many illegal activities, and many of the contents we can find are fake and designed to lure us in in order to scam us. If you wish to explore this world we recommend that you first inform yourself thoroughly on how to completely protect yourself through anonymization and other tools like virtual machines (programs that simulate a whole operating system inside yours, which can be kept isolated).

#### B. Tor
Tor is a project that strives to give internet users the possibility of an anonymous connection, that is, that a user’s activity cannot be traced back to them. It received the Award for Projects of Social Benefit in 2010, given by the Free Software Foundation for “[enabling] roughly 36 million people around the world to experience freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in control of their privacy and anonymity”

Using Tor makes it more difficult to censor or monitor access to certain kinds of content, so it is used when the identity of the user wants to be kept hidden, like when exchanging confidential information.

Tor uses a complex system of encryptions and decryptions in several stages that prevents even the destinataries, who see the decrypted information, from knowing its origin. However, the decrypted information can still be intercepted at the exit nodes, so, while the source will not be detectable, the information might be compromised. To avoid this, other security measures can be taken, like using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

To get an approximate idea of how Tor works, let us imagine the following scenario: You and your friends decided to hold a Secret Santa. The problem is you don’t know how to get your presents to their destinataries without them knowing where they came from, so you decide to do the following. Everyone wraps their present with several layers of wrapping paper, each with a nametag on it, the innermost one containing the name of the intended final recipient. Then, each person gives their gift to the person indicated by the outermost tag. Once you receive a gift, you remove one layer of wrapping paper and then give it to the person whose name you found underneath. Follow this rule until everyone gets a present with a single layer of wrapping paper, which they remove to find their corresponding gift.

This is basically how Tor works: the information is wrapped in several layers of encryption and are then sent through a series of routers that unwrap the encryption layers as they pass it on. When it reaches its final destination, it is impossible to know exactly from which routers it came. Of course, there are more complex mechanisms in place to ensure that the packages really follow the intended course and that it is not possible to trace them back.

#### C. Backdoors
As new measures have been put into place, it is claimed that we should not worry, since it is necessary to sacrifice a small amount of freedom or privacy in order to greatly increase our security, and that if we are not engaging in any criminal activity this should not affect us at all. However, others claim that this surveillance will affect us negatively if we are anything but harmless, uninteresting and conformist members of society. This vision is expressed in the following video:

One of the methods used to access our private information is through backdoors. A backdoor is a method of bypassing authentication mechanisms in an application. They can be used to access contents relevant to security issues, but it also opens up the possibility of accessing private data of a personal nature belonging to innocent citizens.

Often, backdoors are implemented as part of the program itself, which a priori only enables the programmers themselves to use it. This decreases the amount of people who can access our data, but the possibility is still there. In this case, the existence of the backdoor is often kept secret by the developers.

#### D. The Future
There are multiple opinions on how this debate between security, and privacy and freedom, will end. Maybe these positions aren’t really incompatible and we can find a way to increase security without sacrificing our rights to privacy and freedom. 

Increasingly, laws are being made to ensure the privacy of internet users, but it is also important to guarantee the safety of people from attacks. 

Here is a video of how someone pictures internet privacy in the future:

It is interesting to consider the point of view of the speaker: the situation towards which we seem to be heading resembles in some way that of a small town, in which everyone knows what everyone else is doing without a lot of fuss about it. Maybe we should ask ourselves whether, since our “small town” has evolved so much, we should also evolve in our privacy policy.
