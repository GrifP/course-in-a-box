## 4. Group activities

#### A. Internet vs. real world
This activity revolves around our perception of internet and real world surveillance. In all cases, our privacy is diminished, but we might be more willing to accept some of them in order to increase our security.

Each member of the group should take some time to answer whether or not they would allow the following actions:

1. Being recorded in a supermarket.
2. Storing your browsing and shopping information in an online store.
3. Being recorded as you drive through the streets of your city.
4. Having your navigation history systematically stored.
5. Having your cash machine activity recorded.
6. Storing all your online bank activity.

In the odd-numbered questions, real-life situations are presented, whereas in the even-numbered questions, the situations take place on the internet. It is possible that many have been more reluctant to the internet surveillance scenarios.

With the answers previously given, the participants are invited to consider and debate the differences between real-world situations and their internet counterparts. For example, what are your shopping data stored for? Can storing the navigation history of everyone help prevent certain “undesirable” uses of internet, the same way traffic cameras detect infractions? Who is going to know your bank activity and when are they going to use it?

#### B. The defendant is found…

For this activity we need the participants to take on the following roles:

1. **The judge.** Ideally, the person who is teaching the course. You will be the one assumed to be most imparcial.
2. **The robber.** You have been arrested robbing a store. You were the only one inside the store, but it was all orchestrated by your colleague, who is now claiming that they were only waiting in the car because they thought that you were only going to buy something. They made you delete the messages in which you talked about it, but you used a sniffer to steal his authentication credentials in order to recover those messages.
3. **The driver.** You drove and organized  the robbery, the easy part. Now your colleague has been caught, but you plan on blaming it all on them. The only proof of your implication is a bunch of message which you made them delete, so you think you’ve got a good chance.
4. **The jury.** The evidence presented by the robber was not obtained legitimately, but it is the only way of implicating the second culprit. Half the jury must support that the judge use this evidence to make the decision and the other half that using it would set a precedent over allowing violations of privacy. The judge must give out a ruling when they are fully convinced, so it is time to decide, justice or protection?


#### C. True love
This activity is somewhat long, so you might want to consider that before deciding to do it.

Before starting, every participant must  write down three “secret facts” about themselves. They should be things like “my first tooth fell when I was 5” or “I slept with a stuffed animal until I was 20”, but nothing too obvious. These facts must be kept hidden from everyone else for now. All the participants must make pairs (if there is an odd number of people, the organizer must also participate), and we can start the game.

Valentine’s day is here! You don’t have a partner, so you go to a television program where they pair you up with someone and, if you manage to find out more facts about each other than the other pairs, without them finding out yours, you win a romantic trip to the Caribbean!

The rules are simple: you must convene a code with your partner, but you cannot talk about the facts themselves. After that, you will be separated. Each person will then communicate their facts to their partner publicly, for example, writing them using the convened code on a blackboard (if there is any) that anyone can see. If anyone but the partner finds the fact out, it will not count, so be sure to “encrypt” it well! At the end, the pair which has secretly “decrypted” more facts about each other will win!

Here, you are pretending to play for a trip, but in real life your are playing not to publicly expose your private life.
