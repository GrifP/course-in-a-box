## 5. Summary
During this course we have tried to link the concepts of security and privacy, and to show that, while sometimes privacy means security for your personal data, other times security can try to be enforced through a decrease of personal privacy for all.

Privacy is desired by every internet user, but sometimes we have to decide whether we are willing to give it up for our security or the other way around.

We have seen concepts like the deep and the dark web, very little known concepts, Tor, which provides a way of anonymously connecting to the internet, and backdoors, a potential privacy threat. We have also tried to imagine what will happen to privacy in the future.

These concepts lead us to talk about encryption and about the security of our data, which we can summarize in two key pieces of advice:

* Donâ€™t send any personal information unless you know from, to and through where you are sending it.
* If you want to send anything intended for a single recipient, you should consider whether you want to encrypt it so that it can only be accessed with a certain key.

We hope that the group activities have helped to make the concepts more clear and to make you think about them.

Finally, we repeat the question we posed at the beginning, now with more information to handle it: how much of our personal information are we willing to give up in order to be safer?
