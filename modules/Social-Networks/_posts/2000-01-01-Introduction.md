## 1. Introduction
Welcome to this first course on Internet privacy! We hope that it will be useful for you, and, why not, fun.

We decided to begin with social media, and, more specifically, Facebook. Along the rest of the courses we will study other topics related to Internet privacy, like security, information stored online and cookies, but we have chosen to start with social media for its proximity to our daytoday life.

Almost everyone with access to a computer or a mobile device belongs to some social media service, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Whatsapp… and often we think que the things we upload are more private than they really are.

Let us start by watching the following video:

After watching it, do you still believe that what you have uploaded is under your control? For instance, each time you tag a friend, you are giving access to that friend’s friends. There are many factors to consider when you upload something, since our footprint is much harder to erase than to create.

We do not, however, want to say that social media are bad or that you should stop using them, or make you too afraid to use them again, we just want to you to be conscious of the ramifications of uploading a photo or a comment on Facebook.

During this course We intend to talk about modifying your privacy settings in Facebook and the evolution of privacy policies of social media services in the last few years. We also propose some group activities to better absorb these concepts.
