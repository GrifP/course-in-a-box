## 2. Evolution of social networks

#### A. Terms and conditions
Often, in social media (and many other services and applications we use) we accept the terms and conditions without as much as a look. However, they can have a great effect on the privacy that we think we have, and the contents we upload or create can be visible even when it is not our intention.

For example, the last update of terms and conditions from Whatsapp, which was very controversial, asked the users permission to share the user’s account information, like the user’s phone number, with other applications like Facebook or Instagram (they all belong to the same company).

Have you ever disabled the possibility of being found with your phone number on Facebook? If you type your number in the Facebook search bar you might find your name… This is not necessarily due to other applications, since the information might have been stored if you logged into Facebook from your phone.

Later, we will see how to change your privacy settings in order to better control what information about you might be displayed publicly.

#### B. Information and responsibility
In the following video we can see how the amount of people using social media has grown over the last few years:

The video gives us an idea of the enormous amount of people who use social media services, and we should take this into account when using them.

For example, imagine you have 100 friends on Facebook (number that in most cases is really much bigger), and those friends have also 100 friends. That means that, if you tag 5 friends in a photo (underestimating again), this photo is visible for your 100 friends and the 500 friends of your 5 tagged friends. Each person could screenshot the photo or the comment you uploaded and share it with other people via other social media, and you would have just lost control over the photo you’ve uploaded.

These problems don’t come just from what we post for all our friends, but also from the information we share privately through, for example, a chat app.

Think about this example:

Mary and Peter are dating, and Mary decides to send Peter some photos she only wants him to see. Time after, Mary and Peter break up, and Peter finds these photos in his phone. He decides that sharing these photos with his friends in order to laugh a bit lacks importance, so he sends them to, just suppose, 10 friends. When these 10 friends receive the photos, they decide they want to send them to their friends, so suppose each one of them send the photos to 10 friends. This process can take just a few hours or less, and now there are more than 100 people that have Mary’s photos, while she only sent them to one person, thinking her privacy would be kept.

On the one hand, we all are sure that none of us would want to be Mary and also, if she would have known what was going to happen, she would have done what we all must do when using social media: filter the information so we share only what we know isn’t going to hurt us in the future.

On the other hand, this makes us consider our responsibility when sharing information. If the information does not exclusively concern us, we must wonder if the other people that are concerned would want this information to be shared. This way we can prevent people for being harmed through our use of social media, since the impact can be huge.
