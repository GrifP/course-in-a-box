## 3. Protecting your privacy

#### A. Passwords
The first thing we have to consider when protecting ourselves in a social network is there’s no better way to have access to our data than having control of our account. Therefore, the first step in order to increment our privacy in any social media is using a difficult-to-guess password:

You must have a password at least 8 characters long, where upper and lower case letters are mixed with numbers.
* Don’t use patterns like “abcd” or “1234”.
* Don’t use personal information, because it could be easily related to you.
* Don’t tell anyone your password, even if you trust them, and avoid typing it in front of anyone if you think they can see it.
* Don’t use the same password in different accounts.
* Don’t store in the cloud any file where all your passwords appear related to its accounts.

Picture the following cases:
* Our password is “1234abcdABCD”. It follows the first item, but patterns make it an easy-to-guess password.
* You are born in New York in 1990, and your password is NY1990. Searching a little information about you, your password would be easy to guess.
* Mary tells her password to her boyfriend Peter and later on time they break up, but she doesn’t remember she gave it to him. Peter could access Mary’s information after the break up, and keep obtaining it without her consent. She shouldn’t have trusted her password to him.
* There have been several cases where passwords associated to accounts are revealed due to application failures. Yahoo is one of the companies that admitted massive data leaks, but it hasn’t been the one. All passwords that were hacked that time and were used in other accounts make that accounts vulnerable to hacking too.

#### B. Modifying our privacy settings
Facebook offers within its Help Center all the necessary tips to change our account settings. This way, we can manage who has access to each section of your profile.

In the top-right dropdown menu we can find the options to change your privacy settings, aside from options to manage a wide range of other Facebook features.

Let’s see how to change a this privacy.


In the latest Facebook updates, a quick link to privacy has been added in order to make it closer to the user

Other option is making it the old way:

In this Settings tab, we can also see information about our account privacy:

This way, we can be notified when someone logs into our account, we can use our cell phone in order to make our login more secure or we can see which devices are recognised as usual by Facebook.

An interesting option that we encourage you to notice is “Where you’re logged in”, which allows you to see where are you logged in from or if your device has been connected, allowing also to log out those sessions. If you enter and find out there are sessions you haven’t approved, we encourage you to log them out and change your account password. Maybe you could take a few minutes now to take a look to this characteristics.

Let’s move on to the next tab: privacy.


Remember when we’ve talked before about others looking you up using your phone number? Here is where you can modify it to never be done again. When you enter this section, if you see everyone can access this information, you just have to edit it in order to configure how others can look you up. The last option, also activated by default, allows search engines to put a link to your Facebook profile in case anyone looks for you using one. If you don’t want this to happen, it’s time to deactivate this option!

In the next tab, you can verify who can post on your wall or comment in your posts:


And the last tab we’re going to see can be interesting. This tab allows us to block content, apps or even friends in order to prevent them from seeing our posts. Knowing that this option exists is always handy, in order to turn to it if necessary!

#### C. Deleting your account
If you want to erase every trace you left on a social media, one option is to delete your account, although, it will never be possible to fully erase every trace of yourself.

However, before deleting your account and thus losing control over the information you could manage from it, we recommend that you follow these steps:

* Review your publications. If you can remember any comment on someone else’s profile that you might regret, delete it.
* Remove the photos that you don’t want to remain on the site, since sometimes they are saved for the rest of the labeled people in the photo.
* Delete your information on applications on which you log in from your Facebook, since you will lose access to them.
* As you can see, following this advice is not always easy, since we might not remember many of our publications or to which applications we have given access to our information. That is why we insist on that the best thing to do is not to publish potentially harmful stuff in the first place. Furthermore, when you allow an application access to your information, be sure to know what kind of application you’re dealing with and, if you think it might store some information that you might want to delete, don’t allow it, or at least remember it in order to be able to delete it later on.
