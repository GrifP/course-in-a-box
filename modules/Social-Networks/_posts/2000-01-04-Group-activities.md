## 4. Group activities

#### A. Shared privacy
To do this activity, we have assumed that you use Facebook often. We don’t need you to publish every day, we only need you to read the posts your friends write. Take a couple of minutes and, please, answer the following questions:

1. Have you known where an acquaintance has travelled (and when they have done so) through Facebook?
2. Have you discovered any news about your acquaintances’ families through Facebook?
3. Have you ever accepted a friend request from someone you met a long time ago and who was not very close to you? In that case, did you do it because they bring back memories of some past moment?
4. Have you found out more about some friends’ life through Facebook than talking with them?
5. Have you ever used Facebook to nose around someone’s profile anonymously?
6. Have you ever given a “like” to someone’s publication, but you didn’t intend to because you didn’t want them to know you were looking around in their profile?

After answering these questions, we want everybody to count how many times you have answered “no”. In many of the cases, there aren’t  going to be so many.

If you have answered affirmatively to questions 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6, you have used Facebook to take a look into someone’s private life (allowed or not). If they have published it and you’re their Facebook friend, they are supposedly allowing you to see it, but maybe they don’t know that you can see it. In question number 3, you should decide whether that person was close enough in the past to give you the confidence to allow them access to your publications.

Sometimes, it’s not a bad idea to take a look into our list of social networks’ friends, just in case we don’t want all of them to continue finding out about our life.
	
#### B. The opinion we create
This activity is focused on making people aware that it is not only important to control the photos we share, but also the opinions.

We are going to give you some roles (if the group is too big, we can divide it into several little groups, and if the group if too small, we can remove some roles starting at the bottom):

1. **The boss.** You are the boss of a big enterprise. You’ve got a lemma: work hard and work orderly. You like to control how your employees work, and you don’t allow insubordination: your enterprise, your rules. They have to be serious people.
2. **Candidate number 1.** Your life has always been guided. You have never done anything that wasn’t allowed. You have never stood out, you were only good obeying orders. Sometimes, you publish on social networks, but you never publish controversial things.
3. **Candidate number 2.** You were the best student of you year. Your profile is perfect for the position. You’ve got a worried soul. You have found on social networks the way to express your feelings and your thoughts. You write the things you’re disappointed with and you give opinions about controversial issues. However, you have never been a problematic person, you usually just give opinions.
4. **Candidate number 3.** You are good at this kind of job, you are non-conformist but you don’t give this information in the interview and nobody gets it. Sometimes, you have had rebellious acts, but nobody knows it here. You Facebook activity doesn’t exist: four photos on where you were tagged a long time ago and which are not controversial at all.
5. **Candidate number 4.** You are the most experienced candidate. Some years ago, you were tagged on a few photos where you appeared with few clothes and you have never removed this tag.

Now, when everybody has a role, we want you to be creative and imagine the person you are supposed to be. After these few minutes, the boss has to carry out the job interview, where you are going to tell them how capable you are. Then, they are going to spend their afternoon surfing the Internet and looking into your Facebook profiles that, unfortunately, were public.

The boss has to decide, with this information, who is the new employee. Then, you all have to give your opinion about this choice and who you think the best candidate was (now, all people can read other people’s descriptions).

Possibly, the boss is going to give the job to candidate number 4, or maybe candidate number 1. Candidate number 2 was, probably, the best choice, but social networks didn’t give him the chance.

#### C. Searching in the trash
Many times we don’t notice the things we have published because, after some time, we don’t remember them or check them. Let’s try an activity in which we let others see how far can they go in our Facebook profile in only 5-10 minutes.

We will need some device to log into Facebook and we have to befriend the person we will be looking into. If you are not already friends with the corresponding person, you can choose not to do the activity or to delete them after it is over.

Whoever is not willing to share their information available on Facebook with the other participants (which is an absolutely respectable thing to do), should consider whether all their current Facebook friends are more trustworthy of having access to this information.

The participants should form a circle and, during those 5-10 minutes, each person has to access the profile of the person to the right and search for the stuff that seems most controversial. When the time is up, they will show to the researched person what they found. If that person doesn’t want those results to be shown to the rest, they won’t be shown.

The last step is sharing, in turns, the impression made upon us when shown the information found by the person to our left: if we remembered those posts, if we agree with that being public, and so on.
