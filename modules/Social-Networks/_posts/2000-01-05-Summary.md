## 5. Summary
Through this course, the information provided and the activities suggested, weâ€™ve tried to approach the concept of privacy on social networks, but we never wanted to scare users away from the Internet. We never meant that using social networks is bad nor tried to encourage people to stop using them, but we want to raise awareness about the consequences that the use of social networks can have in the long term which, at first, we may not consider.

We summarize in the following tips the most important things to remember to make our use of social media more secure:

* Choose a secure password for your accounts (at least 8 characters with upper- and lowercase letters and numbers) and do not reuse them for different services.
* Find out about your privacy settings and manage them accordingly.
* Do not grant permission to applications before verifying they are safe.
* Access your social media from secure devices and connections.
* Do not publish information through which you can be identified.
* Be careful with which people you add as friends.
* Do not publish inappropriate photos or messages.

Following this advice we can prevent problems like the one that Tim had in the following video:
