# Social Networks

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to this first course on Internet privacy! We hope that it will be useful for you, and, why not, fun.

We decided to begin with social media, and, more specifically, Facebook. Along the rest of the courses we will study other topics related to Internet privacy, like security, information stored online and cookies, but we have chosen to start with social media for its proximity to our daytoday life.

Almost everyone with access to a computer or a mobile device belongs to some social media service, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Whatsapp… and often we think que the things we upload are more private than they really are.

Let us start by watching the following video:

[![Privacy_Online](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-e98hxHZiTg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e98hxHZiTg)

After watching it, do you still believe that what you have uploaded is under your control? For instance, each time you tag a friend, you are giving access to that friend’s friends. There are many factors to consider when you upload something, since our footprint is much harder to erase than to create.

We do not, however, want to say that social media are bad or that you should stop using them, or make you too afraid to use them again, we just want to you to be conscious of the ramifications of uploading a photo or a comment on Facebook.

During this course We intend to talk about modifying your privacy settings in Facebook and the evolution of privacy policies of social media services in the last few years. We also propose some group activities to better absorb these concepts.

## 2. Evolution of social networks

#### A. Terms and conditions
Often, in social media (and many other services and applications we use) we accept the terms and conditions without as much as a look. However, they can have a great effect on the privacy that we think we have, and the contents we upload or create can be visible even when it is not our intention.

For example, the last update of terms and conditions from Whatsapp, which was very controversial, asked the users permission to share the user’s account information, like the user’s phone number, with other applications like Facebook or Instagram (they all belong to the same company).

Have you ever disabled the possibility of being found with your phone number on Facebook? If you type your number in the Facebook search bar you might find your name… This is not necessarily due to other applications, since the information might have been stored if you logged into Facebook from your phone.

Later, we will see how to change your privacy settings in order to better control what information about you might be displayed publicly.

In the following graphic we can see the evolution of Facebook’s default privacy settings through time and what will be displayed to whom on our profiles if we don’t change them: http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy

#### B. Information and responsibility
In the following video we can see how the amount of people using social media has grown over the last few years:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pehq2WC6O10

The video gives us an idea of the enormous amount of people who use social media services, and we should take this into account when using them.

For example, imagine you have 100 friends on Facebook (number that in most cases is really much bigger), and those friends have also 100 friends. That means that, if you tag 5 friends in a photo (underestimating again), this photo is visible for your 100 friends and the 500 friends of your 5 tagged friends. Each person could screenshot the photo or the comment you uploaded and share it with other people via other social media, and you would have just lost control over the photo you’ve uploaded.

These problems don’t come just from what we post for all our friends, but also from the information we share privately through, for example, a chat app.

Think about this example:

Mary and Peter are dating, and Mary decides to send Peter some photos she only wants him to see. Time after, Mary and Peter break up, and Peter finds these photos in his phone. He decides that sharing these photos with his friends in order to laugh a bit lacks importance, so he sends them to, just suppose, 10 friends. When these 10 friends receive the photos, they decide they want to send them to their friends, so suppose each one of them send the photos to 10 friends. This process can take just a few hours or less, and now there are more than 100 people that have Mary’s photos, while she only sent them to one person, thinking her privacy would be kept.

On the one hand, we all are sure that none of us would want to be Mary and also, if she would have known what was going to happen, she would have done what we all must do when using social media: filter the information so we share only what we know isn’t going to hurt us in the future.

On the other hand, this makes us consider our responsibility when sharing information. If the information does not exclusively concern us, we must wonder if the other people that are concerned would want this information to be shared. This way we can prevent people for being harmed through our use of social media, since the impact can be huge.


## 3. Protecting your privacy

#### A. Passwords
The first thing we have to consider when protecting ourselves in a social network is there’s no better way to have access to our data than having control of our account. Therefore, the first step in order to increment our privacy in any social media is using a difficult-to-guess password:

You must have a password at least 8 characters long, where upper and lower case letters are mixed with numbers.
* Don’t use patterns like “abcd” or “1234”.
* Don’t use personal information, because it could be easily related to you.
* Don’t tell anyone your password, even if you trust them, and avoid typing it in front of anyone if you think they can see it.
* Don’t use the same password in different accounts.
* Don’t store in the cloud any file where all your passwords appear related to its accounts.

Picture the following cases:
* Our password is “1234abcdABCD”. It follows the first item, but patterns make it an easy-to-guess password.
* You are born in New York in 1990, and your password is NY1990. Searching a little information about you, your password would be easy to guess.
* Mary tells her password to her boyfriend Peter and later on time they break up, but she doesn’t remember she gave it to him. Peter could access Mary’s information after the break up, and keep obtaining it without her consent. She shouldn’t have trusted her password to him.
* There have been several cases where passwords associated to accounts are revealed due to application failures. Yahoo is one of the companies that admitted massive data leaks, but it hasn’t been the one. All passwords that were hacked that time and were used in other accounts make that accounts vulnerable to hacking too.

#### B. Modifying our privacy settings
Facebook offers within its Help Center all the necessary tips to change our account settings. This way, we can manage who has access to each section of your profile.

In the top-right dropdown menu we can find the options to change your privacy settings, aside from options to manage a wide range of other Facebook features.

Let’s see how to change a this privacy.


In the latest Facebook updates, a quick link to privacy has been added in order to make it closer to the user

Other option is making it the old way:

In this Settings tab, we can also see information about our account privacy:

This way, we can be notified when someone logs into our account, we can use our cell phone in order to make our login more secure or we can see which devices are recognised as usual by Facebook.

An interesting option that we encourage you to notice is “Where you’re logged in”, which allows you to see where are you logged in from or if your device has been connected, allowing also to log out those sessions. If you enter and find out there are sessions you haven’t approved, we encourage you to log them out and change your account password. Maybe you could take a few minutes now to take a look to this characteristics.

Let’s move on to the next tab: privacy.


Remember when we’ve talked before about others looking you up using your phone number? Here is where you can modify it to never be done again. When you enter this section, if you see everyone can access this information, you just have to edit it in order to configure how others can look you up. The last option, also activated by default, allows search engines to put a link to your Facebook profile in case anyone looks for you using one. If you don’t want this to happen, it’s time to deactivate this option!

In the next tab, you can verify who can post on your wall or comment in your posts:


And the last tab we’re going to see can be interesting. This tab allows us to block content, apps or even friends in order to prevent them from seeing our posts. Knowing that this option exists is always handy, in order to turn to it if necessary!

#### C. Deleting your account
If you want to erase every trace you left on a social media, one option is to delete your account, although, it will never be possible to fully erase every trace of yourself.

However, before deleting your account and thus losing control over the information you could manage from it, we recommend that you follow these steps:

* Review your publications. If you can remember any comment on someone else’s profile that you might regret, delete it.
Remove the photos that you don’t want to remain on the site, since sometimes they are saved for the rest of the labeled people in the photo.
* Delete your information on applications on which you log in from your Facebook, since you will lose access to them.
* As you can see, following this advice is not always easy, since we might not remember many of our publications or to which applications we have given access to our information. That is why we insist on that the best thing to do is not to publish potentially harmful stuff in the first place. Furthermore, when you allow an application access to your information, be sure to know what kind of application you’re dealing with and, if you think it might store some information that you might want to delete, don’t allow it, or at least remember it in order to be able to delete it later on.

## 4. Group activities

#### A. Shared privacy
To do this activity, we have assumed that you use Facebook often. We don’t need you to publish every day, we only need you to read the posts your friends write. Take a couple of minutes and, please, answer the following questions:

1. Have you known where an acquaintance has travelled (and when they have done so) through Facebook?
2. Have you discovered any news about your acquaintances’ families through Facebook?
3. Have you ever accepted a friend request from someone you met a long time ago and who was not very close to you? In that case, did you do it because they bring back memories of some past moment?
4. Have you found out more about some friends’ life through Facebook than talking with them?
5. Have you ever used Facebook to nose around someone’s profile anonymously?
6. Have you ever given a “like” to someone’s publication, but you didn’t intend to because you didn’t want them to know you were looking around in their profile?

After answering these questions, we want everybody to count how many times you have answered “no”. In many of the cases, there aren’t  going to be so many.

If you have answered affirmatively to questions 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6, you have used Facebook to take a look into someone’s private life (allowed or not). If they have published it and you’re their Facebook friend, they are supposedly allowing you to see it, but maybe they don’t know that you can see it. In question number 3, you should decide whether that person was close enough in the past to give you the confidence to allow them access to your publications.

Sometimes, it’s not a bad idea to take a look into our list of social networks’ friends, just in case we don’t want all of them to continue finding out about our life.
	
#### B. The opinion we create
This activity is focused on making people aware that it is not only important to control the photos we share, but also the opinions.

We are going to give you some roles (if the group is too big, we can divide it into several little groups, and if the group if too small, we can remove some roles starting at the bottom):

1. **The boss.** You are the boss of a big enterprise. You’ve got a lemma: work hard and work orderly. You like to control how your employees work, and you don’t allow insubordination: your enterprise, your rules. They have to be serious people.
2. **Candidate number 1.** Your life has always been guided. You have never done anything that wasn’t allowed. You have never stood out, you were only good obeying orders. Sometimes, you publish on social networks, but you never publish controversial things.
3. **Candidate number 2.** You were the best student of you year. Your profile is perfect for the position. You’ve got a worried soul. You have found on social networks the way to express your feelings and your thoughts. You write the things you’re disappointed with and you give opinions about controversial issues. However, you have never been a problematic person, you usually just give opinions.
4. **Candidate number 3.** You are good at this kind of job, you are non-conformist but you don’t give this information in the interview and nobody gets it. Sometimes, you have had rebellious acts, but nobody knows it here. You Facebook activity doesn’t exist: four photos on where you were tagged a long time ago and which are not controversial at all.
5. **Candidate number 4.** You are the most experienced candidate. Some years ago, you were tagged on a few photos where you appeared with few clothes and you have never removed this tag.

Now, when everybody has a role, we want you to be creative and imagine the person you are supposed to be. After these few minutes, the boss has to carry out the job interview, where you are going to tell them how capable you are. Then, they are going to spend their afternoon surfing the Internet and looking into your Facebook profiles that, unfortunately, were public.

The boss has to decide, with this information, who is the new employee. Then, you all have to give your opinion about this choice and who you think the best candidate was (now, all people can read other people’s descriptions).

Possibly, the boss is going to give the job to candidate number 4, or maybe candidate number 1. Candidate number 2 was, probably, the best choice, but social networks didn’t give him the chance.

#### C. Searching in the trash
Many times we don’t notice the things we have published because, after some time, we don’t remember them or check them. Let’s try an activity in which we let others see how far can they go in our Facebook profile in only 5-10 minutes.

We will need some device to log into Facebook and we have to befriend the person we will be looking into. If you are not already friends with the corresponding person, you can choose not to do the activity or to delete them after it is over.

Whoever is not willing to share their information available on Facebook with the other participants (which is an absolutely respectable thing to do), should consider whether all their current Facebook friends are more trustworthy of having access to this information.

The participants should form a circle and, during those 5-10 minutes, each person has to access the profile of the person to the right and search for the stuff that seems most controversial. When the time is up, they will show to the researched person what they found. If that person doesn’t want those results to be shown to the rest, they won’t be shown.

The last step is sharing, in turns, the impression made upon us when shown the information found by the person to our left: if we remembered those posts, if we agree with that being public, and so on.


## 5. Summary
Through this course, the information provided and the activities suggested, we’ve tried to approach the concept of privacy on social networks, but we never wanted to scare users away from the Internet. We never meant that using social networks is bad nor tried to encourage people to stop using them, but we want to raise awareness about the consequences that the use of social networks can have in the long term which, at first, we may not consider.

We summarize in the following tips the most important things to remember to make our use of social media more secure:

* Choose a secure password for your accounts (at least 8 characters with upper- and lowercase letters and numbers) and do not reuse them for different services.
* Find out about your privacy settings and manage them accordingly.
* Do not grant permission to applications before verifying they are safe.
* Access your social media from secure devices and connections.
* Do not publish information through which you can be identified.
* Be careful with which people you add as friends.
* Do not publish inappropriate photos or messages.

Following this advice we can prevent problems like the one that Tim had in the following video:
