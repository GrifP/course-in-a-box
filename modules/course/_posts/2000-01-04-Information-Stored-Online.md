III. Information Stored Online
1. Introduction
Welcome to this new course on Internet privacy! This time we will try to give you an overview about how much and what kind of information is stored about you on the network. This information is known as digital footprint.

A digital footprint is made of the whole trail of data we leave behind while using the Internet. There are two types. The active digital footprint is made of all the data we put on the Internet on purpose in websites or social media, usually with the intent of sharing it. The passive digital footprint is made of data collected without the owner knowing. All this data can provide a lot of information about the person to which this data belongs, and information is power. 

Many companies rely on this data to create profiles of users; profiles that can be sold for a reasonable amount of money. Some companies like Facebook uses this data to provide personalized advertisements to users, showing them what they might be interested in, so Facebook can pay its bills with the money they receive from advertising agencies. Other companies may use this data to filter and discard their applicants before making a job interview. More extreme tracking can be made by malware in order to collect passwords or other personal data.

But hey, let’s not freak out! Something being powerful doesn’t mean it's going to be used for evil, but surely digital footprints have some issues with privacy. There are some regulations about it, and there’s definitely a bunch of things you can do to improve your privacy on the Internet. We’re not trying to scare you, we just want you to be aware of it and help you be safe. There are many reasons to care about your digital footprint, as you can see in this video:

OK. So, do you feel like going on?

2. Knowing your digital footprint
A. What is your digital footprint made of?
Your digital footprint is all the stuff you leave behind as you use the Internet, things such as websites, online shopping logs, forum registrations, e-mails and attachments, uploaded videos or digital images and any other form of transmission of information, all of which leaves traces of personal information about yourself available to others online. Some of this data are cookies that are stored in our browser and stores information about our accounts and maybe our navigation habits. Some of them, like posts, comments and likes or retweets, come from our use of social media, which in many cases may be less private than we thought and we’d want to. Some websites may even track which devices log in using the same account, although we should consider that sometimes this makes our access more secure and not less.

Despite this apparent of lack of privacy, not everything is bad. If you think about it, we all also leave a footprint in the real world. We share our tastes, our opinions and our affection to our loved ones. Exactly the same happens in the digital world except that on the Internet all this is usually more public and can potentially reach anyone. We express ourselves on the Internet, we do our daily tasks as we would do in the real world and get in touch with the ones we care about. Our digital footprint is usually a reflection of our lives, including all the good stuff as well.

Also, not everything on the Internet is created for mean purposes. Social networks help us connect with others in many ways, cookies are what make possible logging into diverse accounts and even shopping online, and usage statistics may be collected in order to improve the service. You can also choose what you post so it gives a good image of yourself and grants you a good reputation for anyone looking.

B. Data leaks
In the same way your personal belongings can be stolen in real life, your data can also be stolen on the Internet. Currently, some of the ways your data can be stolen are malware and sniffers. Malware is any kind of malicious software that tries to infect an electronic device to steal information, among other reasons. Malware access to your computer through the Internet and usually makes infected devices slow, and can be detected and suppressed using an antivirus. Sniffers are programs that examine the data traveling through a specific network. Sniffers are more effective on public WiFi, because data is traveling through the air and anyone can access to the network and, with the right program, see what’s happening there. If the data is encoded, the connection will be safe, but this is not generally the case.

Also, your data may be compromised if you store data in the cloud. There have been some cases of celebrities having their data stolen from their personal clouds. This leads us to the following question: Is it safe to store our data in the cloud? Companies that provide cloud storage services tend to spend time and resources improving their security policies. Encoding, two step verification… there are multiple ways to improve their security, but anything can be hacked with enough time and resources (though the amount time and resources needed may be disproportionate). Also, passwords can be leaked due to users’ mistakes, compromising our data. 

Although there are services that can be pretty reliable, it will be always safer to have that data in a hard drive, even more if the device is off or not connected to the internet. The safest would be not having data stored anywhere, but we need somewhere to store our stuff. So, as in real life, we need to protect it.

C. What is your data used for?
Your data is worth a lot of money. Literally. Your data can be helpful to build a really accurate, precise and detailed profile of you, and this is like a gold mine for publicity agencies. Because of this, there are enterprises that organize, analyze and pack all the information from our digital footprint in order to create leads, in other words, profiles made with verified data. They may even use special offers to collect data directly from the users via forms. Then they send these leads to publicity agencies for several dollars each, so they can use it in order to target specific users and send them the offers that they may like the most. That’s why we get emails from websites we haven’t heard about with offers that can interest us.

Also, your data may be used in a malicious way. Your personal data like accounts, passwords, credit cards or bank accounts can be hacked, collected and sold between malicious individuals or criminal groups that can take your place. Also, in a more extreme scenario, your personal data, like your real name, your home address or other data from you or your relatives can be used to trick you or blackmail you.

3. Improving your privacy
A. Basic tips for improving your privacy
Maybe at this point of the course you’ll be concerned about your privacy and all the personal data that may be on the Internet. Now it’s time to get on with improving your privacy and helping you be safe on the Internet. Using the Internet and leaving no digital footprint is impossible, but we can reduce it. There are some tips that can help you achieve it.

First things first, you have to care about your passwords. Here are little pieces of advice in order to improve your passwords security:
Change your passwords regularly.
Don’t use the same password in different accounts or websites.
Have passwords at least 8 characters long (the longer the better) that mixes upper and lower case letters with numbers.
Don’t let others use your personal devices.
Lock your device in case of loss or theft
Don’t send sensitive data via WiFi, especially via public WiFi.

Other option for improving your privacy is using alternative email accounts, in other words, email accounts that we use only to register in apps and are not our usual account that we use to communicate on a daily bases. Also there are temporary email accounts, that is, email accounts that have a limited lifespan, for example, 60 minutes. These services are created so users can log into websites or apps that they are going to use just once. This way, the users can protect their privacy by not providing an email account with any kind of personal data. This way we scatter the information we put on the Internet, so it’s more difficult to put it up together in order to build a profile about you. 

Last but not least, install an antivirus. This will keep you protected from malware that tries to steal your data. And one final note: encryption is important. If your data is encrypted, it will be hard to read if stolen. This is a more complicated topic we are not going to cover now, but just one tip: when your are browsing on the Internet use HTTPS instead of HTTP when possible. You will see it in your browser:

B. Regulation: right to be forgotten
As many aspects of privacy, digital footprints and the use of personal data are regulated by the laws of the country in which the website is registred.

For example, in the U.S.A., invasion of privacy can be used as cause of action (legal claim for which to seek compensation) in legal disputes. There are four categories:

Intrusion of solitude: it arises where one person intrudes upon the private affairs of another, physically or electronically. For example, hacking into someone else's computer can be a type of intrusion.
Public disclosure of private facts: it happens when someone reveals another person’s private information, when this information is not of public interest and its publication or dissemination can be considered offensive.
False light: it’s the publication of facts that are highly offensive or embarrassing to reasonable people, with the act being carried out with malice. This term is similar to defamation, although it’s not the same, since the information needs not be false, but only misleading.
Appropriation: it’s the unauthorized use of another person's name or likeness to obtain some benefits, and can violate either an individual’s right of privacy or right of publicity.

If we want to delete our digital footprint, there are many ways to reduce it, but it’s impossible to completely delete it. Some places in the world have laws that implement “the right to be forgotten”. The right to be forgotten reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them. This is a relatively new idea in the US, and it’s not yet implemented. In the European Union, Google put at users’ disposal a form in which users can ask Google to delete any information they have about them, in order to keep the right to be forgotten. You can see the form in the next link:

4. Group activities
A. You on the internet
In order to do this activity, you just need a device with a browser. It’s preferable that you aren’t logged into any account or social media in the browser. Take some time (5 minutes will be probably enough) to google yourself and browse through the results. After everyone is finished, answer in turns the following questions:

How many links have you found that were about you?
How many of them were social media? How many were blogs, posts or articles? In case there were other kind of content, what kind was it?
Did you expect there to be less? Did you expect there to be more? 
How much personal information did you find? Was it sensitive information?
Are you now more concerned about your privacy than before?

It is probable that you didn’t find many results. If you are not a public person nor use the Internet intensively, there might not be much relevant information about you. Also, many times we use nicknames in social media, so the link between those accounts and you isn’t so obvious.

B. My activity on Google
My Activity is a central place to view and manage activity like searches you've done, websites you've visited, and videos you've watched. As they themselves say, this data helps Google make your experience faster and more useful. This time you’re going to enter https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity and browse through your data. This will take you more time, around 10-15 minutes. We strongly recommend you to scatter around a little bit, if possible, in order to have some privacy. When time’s up, gather again and answer the following questions:


How much information have you found about you?
Were you aware that Google was collecting this data?
How much personal information did you find? Was it sensitive information?
Are you now more concerned about your privacy than before?

My Activity also provides you with a way of deleting this data, so you can come back later to delete whatever you like. We also recommend to take a look at your Google settings in order to see and modify your privacy settings and the amount of information Google is collecting about you.
